# In Python - Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, a low number
# and a high number. The program will contain two for loops:
#       1. In the first loop, the low number will be the starting point for the loop and the
#       high will be the ending point. The loop should display the iterator number and
#       that number x 10 on the same line, separated by a tab. See example on p. 177.
#       2. The second loop should accumulate all the numbers between the starting point
#       and ending point. You will need to create and initialize an accumulator such as
#       total before you start the loop.
