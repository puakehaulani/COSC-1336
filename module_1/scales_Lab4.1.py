# Chapter 4 Loops
# Problem 1.  Budgeted vs. Actual Expenses
# Write program that asks the user to enter the amount that he or she has budgeted for a month.  Using a while loop, the user should be prompted to enter each of his or her expenses for the month and keep a running total.  When the loop finishes, the program should display the amount that the user is over or under budget.
# Design. Use an IPO diagram to design your program. See IPO diagram attached to this assignment.   
# Code.  Write your program in Python using the above steps. Save your program as a .py file with the name yourlastname_Lab4.1.py 
# Output.  Your program should produce correctly labeled output with dollar amounts rounded to 2 decimal places and dollar signs.  Sample dialog:  
# Enter amount budgeted for the month: 500
# Enter an amount spent(0 to quit): 50
# Enter an amount spent(0 to quit): 75
# Enter an amount spent(0 to quit): 800
# Enter an amount spent(0 to quit): 23.95
# Enter an amount spent(0 to quit): 0
# Budgeted: $ 500.00
# Spent: $ 948.95
# You are $ 448.95 over budget. PLAN BETTER NEXT TIME!


# Programming Style Requirements.  
# Comments – Begin your program with a comment that includes: a) your name, b)program status – either “Complete” or describe any incomplete or non-functioning part of your program c)A 1-3 line description of what the program does.
# Variable names – use meaningful variable names such as total_taxes or num_cookies.
# Named constants – Use named constants for all number values that will not be changed in the program such as RECIPE_SUGAR = 1.5.   See section 2.9 on Named Constants

# You will have two .py  files and one IPO file to turn in to Blackboard.
