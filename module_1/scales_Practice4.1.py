# 1. In Python, use your if-elif-else program from Practice Assignment 3-2,
#       that asks for a number and prints the day of the week.
#       Add logic to this program that uses a loop to keep asking the user the day of the week until they wish to stop.
#       You will use a while loop to do this.
# 2. In a second program:
#       Write a while loop that asks the user to enter two numbers.
#       The numbers should be added and the sum displayed.
#       The loop should ask the user if he or she wishes to perform the operation again.
#       If so, the loop should repeat, otherwise it should terminate.
# 3. Turn in your programs to the practice assignment link in course
