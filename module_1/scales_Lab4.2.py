# Problem 2.  Ocean Levels
# Assuming the ocean’s level is currently rising at about 1.8 millimeters per year, create an application that displays the number of millimeters that the ocean will have risen each year for the next 25 years.
# Design. Use an IPO diagram to design your program. See IPO diagram attached to this assignment.   
# Code.  Write your program in Python using the above steps. Save your program as a .py file with the name yourlastname_Lab4.2.py 
# Output.  Your program output should look something like this:
# Year		Rise (in millimeters)
# ------------------------------------------
# 1 		 1.80
# 2 		 3.60
# 3 		 5.40
# 4 		 7.20
# 5 		 9.00
# 6 		 10.80
# 7 		 12.60
# 8 		 14.40
# 9 		 16.20
# 10 		 18.00
# 11 		 19.80
# 12 		 21.60
# 13 		 23.40
# 14 		 25.20
# 15 		 27.00
# 16 		 28.80
# 17 		 30.60
# 18 		 32.40
# 19 		 34.20
# 20 		 36.00
# 21 		 37.80
# 22 		 39.60
# 23 		 41.40
# 24 		 43.20
# 25 		 45.00

# Programming Style Requirements.  
# Comments – Begin your program with a comment that includes: a) your name, b)program status – either “Complete” or describe any incomplete or non-functioning part of your program c)A 1-3 line description of what the program does.
# Variable names – use meaningful variable names such as total_taxes or num_cookies.
# Named constants – Use named constants for all number values that will not be changed in the program such as RECIPE_SUGAR = 1.5.   See section 2.9 on Named Constants

# You will have two .py  files and one IPO file to turn in to Blackboard.
