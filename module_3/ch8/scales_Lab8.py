# Lab 8 - Strings

# Problem 1. Character Analysis –Use the file text.txt that is attached to Blackboard.   Write a program that reads the file’s contents and determines the following:

# The number of uppercase letters in the file
# The number of lowercase letters in the file
# The number of digits in the file
# The number of whitespace characters in the file

# Output should look like this:

# Uppercase letters: 20
# Lowercase letters: 310
# Digits: 4
# Spaces: 82
# >>>

# Hint:  This program does not need to use any lists – the entire file can be read into one string.

# Problem 2.  Date Printer - Write a program that reads a string from the user containing a date in the form mm/dd/yyyy.   It should print the date in the format March 12, 2018.  

# Sample dialog:
# Enter a date in the format mm/dd/yyyy: 01/16/2018
# January 16, 2018

# You should have 2 .py files to turn in.
