# Lab 7 – Lists:  Larger Than N
# In a program, write a function that accepts two arguments: a list, and a number n. Assume that the list contains numbers. The function should display all of the numbers in the list that are greater than the number n.

# You will create your program in the IDLE environment and save it as a python file.  Use the file naming convention yourlastname_Lab7.py.
# Modularity – Your program should have at least these two functions:
# main – should accept input of a series of 10 integers from the user and an integer n that will be the search number.  main should call the function display_larger and pass 2 arguments:   the 10 integers stored in a list, and the number n.  

# display_larger – should accept the 2 parameters from main.   Using a loop, the function should compare all numbers in the list of number from the user to n.   If the number is larger than n, it should be stored in a second list containing only the numbers that are greater than n.

# This function should display:   The original list, n, and the list of numbers greater than n.
# Sample Dialog/Output:

    # Enter a list of 10 integers
    # Enter a number: 10
    # Enter a number: 20
    # Enter a number: 30
    # Enter a number: 40
    # Enter a number: 5
    # Enter a number: 66
    # Enter a number: 77
    # Enter a number: 88
    # Enter a number: 99
    # Enter a number: 33
    # Enter the number you wish to test if the ist elements are greater than: 45
    # Number: 45
    # List of numbers:
    # [10, 20, 30, 40, 5, 66, 77, 88, 99, 33]
    # List of numbers that are larger than 45:
    # [66, 77, 88, 99]
 
# Programming Style Requirements.  
# 	•	Comments – Begin your program with a comment that includes: a) your name, b)program status – either “Complete” or describe any incomplete or non-functioning part of your program c)A 1-3 line description of what the program does.
# 	•	Function comments – each function should begin with a comment explaining what the function does
# 	•	Variable names – use meaningful variable names such as total_taxes or num_cookies.
# 	•	Function names – use meaningful verb names for functions such as display_taxes. 
# 	•	Named constants – Use named constants for all number values that will not be changed in the program such as RECIPE_SUGAR = 1.5.   See section 2.9 on Named Constants
