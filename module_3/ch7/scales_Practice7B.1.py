# Practice Assignment Ch. 7-3
# 1. Write a program that contains a main function and a
# sub-function called total_list.
# 2. The main function will create two lists containing five
# integers (of your choosing) each
# 3. The main function will join the two lists together, sort
# the resulting 10 integer list, and pass it to the
# total_list function
# 4. The total_list function will total the integers in the
# list and return the total to the main function
# 5. The main function will print the list, print the total, and
# print the maximum and minimum values in the list.
