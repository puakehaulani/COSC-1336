# Lab 10 â€“ Classes 
#  Main program: 
# Your main program should create three instances of the class.   Your program should get the information from the user and pass it as parameters to the initializer method.    Using the __str__ method invoked by the print function, the program should display the personal information for the three individuals.  

# Output and Sample Dialog: 
# Enter employee name: Mary Smith 
# Enter employee ID:  123456 
# Enter department: Accounting 
# Enter position: Accountant 

# Enter employee name: Joe Morales 
# Enter employee ID:  678910 
# Enter department: Engineering 
# Enter position: Engineer 

# Enter employee name: Marie Zinc 
# Enter employee ID:  45678 
# Enter department: Customer Service 
# Enter position: Customer Service Rep 


# Employee  1 : 
# Name: Mary Smith 
# ID number: 123456 
# Department: Accounting 
# Title: Accountant 

# Employee  2 : 
# Name: Joe Morales 
# ID number: 678910 
# Department: Engineering 
# Title: Engineer 

# Employee  3 : 
# Name: Marie Zinc 
# ID number: 45678 
# Department: Customer Service 
# Title: Customer Service Rep 

# Note:   You may not actually be using the setter and getter methods but to be complete, your class needs to include them.     
# See Cellphone class example.  Instead of using this method of printing, invoke __str__  in main by using  print(object_name). 
# Turn in two files, employee.py and your main program (yourlastname_Lab10.py).
