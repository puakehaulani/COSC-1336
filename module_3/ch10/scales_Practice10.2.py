# Practice Assignment Ch. 10-2
# Work in groups of 2. (Online students work on your own) One person
# writes the class, one writes the program to implement the class.
# You should have 2 files:
# • One for the class
# • One for the class implementation (main program)

# 1. Pet Class
# Write a class named Pet, which should have the following data attributes:
# • __name (for the name of a pet)
# • __animal_type (for the type of animal that a pet is. Example values are 'Dog', 'Cat', and 'Bird')
# • __age (for the pet's age)

# The Pet class should have an __init__ method that creates these atrributes. It should also have the following methods:

# • set_name
#   This method assigns a value to the __name field
# • set_animal_type
#   This method assigns a value to the __animal_type field
# • set_age
#   This method assigns a value to the __age field
# • get_name
#   This method returns the value of the __name field
# • get_animal_type
#   This method returns the value of the __animal_type field
# • get_age
#   This method returns the value of the __age field

# Once you have written the class, write a program that creates an object of the class and prompts the user to enter the name, type, and age of his or her pet.
# This data should be stored as the object's attributes. Use the object's accessor methods to retrieve the pet's name, type, and age, and display this data on the screen.
