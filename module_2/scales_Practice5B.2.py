# Work in groups of two (online students work on your own). You will
# write a program that will calculate the area of a square based on a
# randomly generated integer to be used as the side.
# Person 1 –write the main function which will:
# 1. Generate a random integer between 1 and 100 which will be the
# side of the square
# 2. Pass that number to called functions called square_area and
# square_perimeter.
# 3. Display the side, the returned area, and the returned perimeter.
# Person 2 – in a separate file called square.py:
# 1. Define a function called square_area which will accept the side
# from main, calculate the square area, and returns it to main.
# 2. Define a function called square_perimeter which will accept
# the side from main, calculate the square perimeter, and return it
# to main.
# Turn in your 2 .py files to the practice assignment link in course content.
