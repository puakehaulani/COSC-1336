# 1. Kilometer Converter - Write a program that asks the user to enter a
# distance in kilometers, and then converts that distance to miles. The
# conversion formula is as follows:
# Miles = Kilometers x 0.6214
# 2. Your program should have two functions: a main function and a function
# to convert and print the miles
# 3. The main function should ask the user for number of kilometers and pass
# that to the conversion function.
# 4. The conversion function should calculate the miles and then display to
# user
# 5. Use a global constant for the conversion factor
# 6. Turn in your program to the practice assignment link in course content.
