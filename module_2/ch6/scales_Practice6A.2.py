# Program 1 - Write numbers to a file:
# 1. Open an output file with the filename number_list.txt
# 2. Use a loop to write the numbers 50 through 100 to the
# file, and then close the file. Be sure to save your file to
# use in the next assignment
# Program 2 â€“ Read numbers from a file:
# 1. Open the file you just created.
# 2. Read all the numbers from the file and display them.
# Terminate the loop by detecting end of file with a for loop
# (the second method we discussed).
# Turn in your two program files to the practice assignment link
# in course content.
