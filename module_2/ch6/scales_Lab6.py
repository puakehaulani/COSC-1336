# Lab 6 – Files:  Random Numbers 

# You will create each program in the IDLE environment and save it as a python file.  Use the file naming convention yourlastname_Lab6.n.py  where “n” is the exercise number.


#    Problem 8 should also display the average of the random numbers.
# Exception Handling:   Both programs should use Try and Except Clauses to handle IOError, ValueError, and unspecified error exceptions.   Be sure to test your programs for invalid cases.  For example ,  try running the second program to read the file when it doesn’t exist or manually put bad data in the file and see what happens.  
# Programming Style Requirements.  
# 	•	Comments – Begin your program with a comment that includes: a) your name, b)program status – either “Complete” or describe any incomplete or non-functioning part of your program c)A 1-3 line description of what the program does.
# 	•	Function comments – each function should begin with a comment explaining what the function does
# 	•	Variable names – use meaningful variable names such as total_taxes or num_cookies.
# 	•	Function names – use meaningful verb names for functions such as display_taxes. 
# 	•	Named constants – Use named constants for all number values that will not be changed in the program such as RECIPE_SUGAR = 1.5.   See section 2.9 on Named Constants

# You should have 2 program files to turn in.
