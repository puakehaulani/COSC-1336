# Program 2 â€“ Read numbers from a file:
# 1. Open the file you just created.
# 2. Read all the numbers from the file and display them.
# Terminate the loop by detecting end of file with a for loop
# (the second method we discussed).
# Turn in your two program files to the practice assignment link
# in course content.

# this program reads numbers from a file and displays them
