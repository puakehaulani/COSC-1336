# In Python, write a program to generate a random floating point number between 1
# and 100 which will be used as the radius of a circle. In a separate function, calculate
# the area of a circle based on the radius your program just generated and return it to
# the main function. In the main function, display the radius and the area.
# Turn in your program to the practice assignment link in course content.
